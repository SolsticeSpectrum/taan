## üìú About

Taan (meaning "a musical phrase" in Hindustani classical music) is a lightweight, fast, and native desktop client for Spotify. This project is in its very early stages of development, aiming to provide a clean and minimal user experience for listening to music on Spotify.

## ‚ú® Features

Currently, Taan is a work-in-progress. Here are some of the features that are being worked on:

- [ ] Spotify authentication
- [ ] Playback of Spotify tracks
- [ ] Viewing playlists, albums, and artists
- [ ] A clean, minimal, and native user interface

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Rust**: The core language for the application.
- **Xilem**: A modern Rust UI framework for building native applications.
- **librespot**: An open-source client library for Spotify.
- **rspotify**: A Rust wrapper for the Spotify Web API.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Rust**: Make sure you have the latest stable version of Rust installed. You can get it from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
